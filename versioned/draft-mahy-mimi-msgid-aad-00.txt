  Conveying the More Instant Messaging Interoperability Message ID in
         Messaging Layer Security Additional Authenticated Data
                      draft-mahy-mimi-msgid-aad-00

Abstract

   The More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI) content format
   defines a MIMI Message ID, communicated only to members of the
   Messaging Layer Security (MLS) group in which the message was sent.
   This document defines a way to share a Message ID in the MLS
   Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) so it is visible to MIMI
   providers.

1.  Introduction

   Many messaging protocols and formats have a Message ID.  The MIMI
   content format defines how to calculate a MIMI Message ID Section 3.3
   of [I-D.ietf-mimi-content] for an application message.  A MIMI
   Message ID is currently only shared end-to-end encrypted with members
   of the MLS [RFC9420] group in which the message was sent.  This
   document defines an optional mechanism to share a Message ID in the
   MLS AAD, so it is visible to intermediary providers.  This greatly
   facilitates debugging and troubleshooting, but causes a modest
   reduction in privacy.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Mechanism

   This document defines a new Safe AAD message_id component as
   described in Section 4.9 of [I-D.ietf-mls-extensions].

   When the content of an MLS application message is a MIMI content
   message (media type application/mimi-content), if the message_id
   component is present inside SafeAAD.aad_items, it MUST contain the
   MIMI content Message ID calculated as described in Section 3.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-mimi-content].

      To the extent that other application formats or media types have a
      Message ID, the Message ID for an application message of that type
      or format MAY be conveyed in this extension.

4.  Security Considerations

   An attacker with access to a fragment of message history, and the
   message logs of a MIMI provider in the path of a message could
   potentially learn more about the participants of a particular MIMI
   room or the room's corresponding MLS group.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  message_id MLS Component Type

   This document registers a new MLS Component Type in the Specification
   Required range with the following template:

   *  Value: TBD (new assignment by IANA)

   *  Name: message_id

   *  Where: AD

   *  Recommended: Y

   *  Reference: RFC XXXX
